# Sympy for integration

It should come as no surprise to discover that sympy can do integration as well as differentiation.   The code in `main.py` calculates the indefinite integrals of a number of standard functions.  Run the code to check that it works.  

__Once you understand, modify these examples so as to set following variables equal to the following integrals__

1. `ilog` should be set equal to ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\int \log(x)\textrm{d}x)
2. `itan` should be set equal to ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\int \tan(x)\textrm{d}x)
3. `ixex` should be set equal to ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\int x\exp(x)\textrm{d}x)

These integrals should be determined using sympy.  Notice that sympy omits the constant term when it calculates these indefinite integrals.  You know that the constant term should be there, however.
